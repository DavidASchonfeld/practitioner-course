How do Websites Work? (A Review):
Note: Yes, I know this already, but it's a nice review

-- websites live on servers.
----- Has an IP Address (same concept as a physical address)
-- network aka the internet. connects clients to websites
-- clients (aka each of us on our laptops through the internet browser)
----- Has an IP Address (same concept as a physical address)


What is in a Server:
-- CPU - will be doing computations. 
-- RAM (Memory): fast memory to allow us to store/retrieve information quickly.

-- Data (aka Storage). For example: Files, Database (store data in structured way), etc.

-- Network: Routers, Switch, DNS Server,


IT Terminology:
-- Network: a bunch of cables, routers and servers connected with each other
-- Router: A networking device  that forwards data packets between computer networks. They know where to send your packets on the internet!
-- Switch: Once your data packet arrives, it takes a packet and sends it ot the correct server/client on your network.


Traditional IT Infrastrutuce

-- used to have physical servers in their homes, garages etc. for their website(s).
As your websites grow, you need more servers, so your home gets filled with servers.
So you move your physical servers into a special room called a Data Center (room with all of your servers.) You scale up your Data Center by buying more servers.


Problems with Traditional IT Approach
-- pay for rent for the data Center
-- pay for power supply, cooling, maintenance
-- adding and replacing hardware takes time.
-- scaling is limited. (If tomorrow, you need 10x more servers, that's hard to do really quickly)
-- hire 24/7 team to monitor the infrastructure.
-- How to deal with disasters? (earthquake, power shutdown, fire...)

Can we externalize all this? Yes -> on the cloud (For Next lecture)
