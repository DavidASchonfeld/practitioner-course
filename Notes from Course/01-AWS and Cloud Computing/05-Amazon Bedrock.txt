Amazon Bedrock - Foundation models
-- Access to a wide range of Foundation Models (FM)
-----Ex: AI21 labs, cohere, stability.ai, amazon, anthropic, Meta (aka Facebook), Mistral AI
-- Amazon Bedrock makes a copy of the FM (aka of the Foundational Model), available only to you, which you can further fine-tune with your own data.
-- None of your data is used to train the FM (aka none of your data is sent back to the FM, so your data stays in your account.)
