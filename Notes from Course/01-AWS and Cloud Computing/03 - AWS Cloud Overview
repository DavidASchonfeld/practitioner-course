AWS Cloud Overview



AWS Cloud History

-- 2002: Internally launched
-- 2003: Amazon infrastructure is one of their core strengths. Idea to manage infrastructure for others
-- 2004: Launched publicly with SQS (their 1st public offering)
-- 2006: re-launcehd with SQS, S3 and EC2
-- 2007: Launched in Europe (started in US beforehand)
-- Now, other companies use AWS, like: Netflix, Dropbox, Airbnb and NASA


AWS Cloud Number Facts
-- Shows a graph showing that AWS is doing reall well, called the "Gartner Magic Quadrant, a Magic Quadrant for Strategic Cloud Platform Services"
-- In 2023, AWS had $90 billion in annual revenue
-- AWS accounts for 31% of the market in Q1 2024 (Microsoft in 2nd with 25%)
-- Pioneer and Leader of the AWS Cloud Market for the 13th consecutive year
-- Over 1,000,000 active users


AWS Cloud Use Cases
-- AWS enables to build sophisticated, scalable applications
-- Applicable to a diverse set of industries
-- Use cases include
---- Enterprise IT, Backup & Storage, Big Data analytics
---- Website hosting, Mobile & Social Apps (backend for that)
---- Gaming


AWS Global Infrastructure
-- AWS Regions
-- AWS Availability Zones
-- AWS Data Centers
-- AWS Edge Locations/Points of Presence
URL for Map to see all of the physical locations: "infrastructure.aws"


AWS Regions
-- AWS has Regions all around the world
-- AWS Region: A cluster of data centers
-- Examples: "us-east-1", "eu-west-3", etc.
-- Most AWS services are region-scoped (meaning, specific things you do in 1 region might not transfer over to the same service in a different region.)


How to choose an AWS Region?
(This question will probably come up in the exam.)

-- Compliance with data governance and legal requirements: data never leaves a region without your explicity permission (Some governments want your data to be local in the country that you are operating in.)

-- Latency/Proximity: reduced latency (aka lag/delay). If your data is stored close to your customers (aka in the same country), your cusrtoemrs will have less lag when using your application

-- Available Services within a Region: new services and new features aren't available in every Region.

-- Pricing: pricing varies region to region and is transparent in the service pricing page.


AWS Availability Zones:
-- Each region has many availability zones:
(Usually 3, minimum: 3, maximum: 6).
-- Example: Sydney: ap-southeast-2
----- ap-southeast-2a
----- ap-southeast-2b
----- ap-southeast-2c

-- Each availability zone (AZ) is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking and connectivity
--- Example: I could have 2 data centers in 2a, 2 data centers in 2b and 1 data center in 2c
-- The availability zones are separate from each other, so that they're isolated from disasters.
-- They're conencted with high bandwidth, ultra-low latency networking


AWS Points of Presence (aka Edge Locations)
-- Amazon has 400+ Points of Presence (400+ Edge Locations  & 10+ Regional Caches) in 90+ cities across 40+ countries
-- Content is delivered to end users with lower latency



Tour of the AWS Console
-- AWS has Global Services
---- Identity and Access Management (IAM)
---- Route 53 (DNS service)
---- CloudFront (Content Delivery Network)
---- WAF (Web Application Firewall)
-- Most AWS services are Region-scoped:
---- Amazon EC2 (Infrastructure as a Service)
---- Elastic Beanstalk (Platform as a Service)
---- Lambda (Function as a Service)
----- Rekognition (Software as a Service)

Note: Use the AWS Global Infrastructure page to check which resources are available in each region. That way, if you are following along in the class and need to use a specific resource and it is missing in your region, you can check this page to see which region(s) that resource is available in (and switch to using that region).
