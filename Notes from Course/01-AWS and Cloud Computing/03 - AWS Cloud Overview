AWS Cloud Overview



AWS Cloud History

-- 2002: Internally launched
-- 2003: Amazon infrastructure is one of their core strengths. Idea to manage infrastructure for others
-- 2004: Launched publicly with SQS (their 1st public offering)
-- 2006: re-launcehd with SQS, S3 and EC2
-- 2007: Launched in Europe (started in US beforehand)
-- Now, other companies use AWS, like: Netflix, Dropbox, Airbnb and NASA


AWS Cloud Number Facts
-- Shows a graph showing that AWS is doing reall well, called the "Gartner Magic Quadrant, a Magic Quadrant for Strategic Cloud Platform Services"
-- In 2023, AWS had $90 billion in annual revenue
-- AWS accounts for 31% of the market in Q1 2024 (Microsoft in 2nd with 25%)
-- Pioneer and Leader of the AWS Cloud Market for the 13th consecutive year
-- Over 1,000,000 active users


AWS Cloud Use Cases
-- AWS enables to build sophisticated, scalable applications
-- Applicable to a diverse set of industries
-- Use cases include
---- Enterprise IT, Backup & Storage, Big Data analytics
---- Website hosting, Mobile & Social Apps (backend for that)
---- Gaming


AWS Global Infrastructure
-- AWS Regions
-- AWS Availability Zones
-- AWS Data Centers
-- AWS Edge Locations/Points of Presence
URL for Map to see all of the physical locations: "infrastructure.aws"


AWS Regions
-- AWS has Regions all around the world
-- AWS Region: A cluster of data centers
-- Examples: "us-east-1", "eu-west-3", etc.
-- Most AWS services are region-scoped (meaning, specific things you do in 1 region might not transfer over to the same service in a different region.)


How to choose an AWS Region?
(This question will probably come up in the exam.)

-- Compliance with data governance and legal requirements: data never leaves a region without your explicity permission (Some governments want your data to be local in the country that you are operating in.)

-- Latency/Proximity: reduced latency (aka lag/delay). If your data is stored close to your customers (aka in the same country), your cusrtoemrs will have less lag when using your application

-- Available Services within a Region: new services and new features aren't available in every Region.

-- Pricing: pricing varies region to region and is transparent in the service pricing page.


AWS Availability Zones:
-- Each region has many availability zones:
(Usually 3, minimum: 3, maximum: 6).
-- Example: Sydney: ap-southeast-2
----- ap-southeast-2a
----- ap-southeast-2b
----- ap-southeast-2c

-- Each availability zone (AZ) is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking and connectivity
--- Example: I could have 2 data centers in 2a, 2 data centers in 2b and 1 data center in 2c
-- The availability zones are separate from each other, so that they're isolated from disasters.
-- They're conencted with high bandwidth, ultra-low latency networking


AWS Points of Presence (aka Edge Locations)
-- Amazon has 400+ Points of Presence (400+ Edge Locations  & 10+ Regional Caches) in 90+ cities across 40+ countries
-- Content is delivered to end users with lower latency



Tour of the AWS Console
-- AWS has Global Services
---- Identity and Access Management (IAM)
---- Route 53 (DNS service)
---- CloudFront (Content Delivery Network)
---- WAF (Web Application Firewall)
-- Most AWS services are Region-scoped:
---- Amazon EC2 (Infrastructure as a Service)
---- Elastic Beanstalk (Platform as a Service)
---- Lambda (Function as a Service)
----- Rekognition (Software as a Service)

Note: Use the AWS Global Infrastructure page to check which resources are available in each region. That way, if you are following along in the class and need to use a specific resource and it is missing in your region, you can check this page to see which region(s) that resource is available in (and switch to using that region).

Shared Responsibility Model Diagram

-- In the Cloud: Your responsibility (as a customer of AWS)
-- The Cloud Itself: AWS's responsibility.


AWS Acceptable Use Policy
Note: This is all very obvious, but I'm writing it down in case I need to know/list these specific descriptions for the exam
-- No Illegal, Harmful, or Offfensive Use or Content
-- No Security Violations
-- No Network Abuse
-- No E-Mail or Other Message Abuse



Qs and Answers:
Question 1) You only want to manage Applications and data. Which type of Cloud Computing model should you use?

Answer: Platform as a Service (PaaS): 

Question 2) What is the pricing model of Cloud Computing?

Answer: Pay-as-you-go


Question 3) Which Global Infrastructure identitiy is composed of 1+ discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity, and are used to deploy infrastructure?
Answer: Availabity Zones (the question above is the defintion of "Availablity Zones)


NOT "Edge Locaitons". "Edge Locations": caching sites to deliver content to end users with lower latency. They are located in Availability Zones. They are not used to dpeloy infrastructure, but for aching content.

Question 4) Which of the following is NOT one of the Five Characteristics?
-- Rapid elasticity and scalability
-- Multi-tenancy and resource pooling
-- Dedicated Support Agent to help you deploy applications <- This is the answer
-- On-demand self service

Question 5)
Which are the 3 pricing fundamentals of the AWS Cloud?

Answer: Compute, Storage and Data transfer out the AWS Cloud

Question 6) Which of the following options is NOT a point of consideration when choosing an AWS Region?
-- Compliance with data governance
-- Latency
-- Capacity availabiltiy <- Answer
-- Pricing

Question 7) Which of the following is NOT an advantage of Cloud Computing?
-- Trade capital expense (CAPEX) for operational expense (OPEX)
-- Train your employees less <- Answer.
-- Go global in minutes
-- Stop spending money running and maintaing data centers.

Question 8) AWS Regions are comprised of?
-- Two or more Edge Loations
-- One or more discrete data centers
-- Three or more Availability Zones <-Answer

Question 9: Whihc of the following services has a global scope?
-- EC2
-- IAM <- This is the answer since it manages all users and permissions (IAM stands for "Identity and Access Management").
-- Lambda
-- Rekognition

Question 10:
-- Rapidly develop, test and launch software applications
-- Automatic and quick ability to acquire resources as you need them and release resources when you no longer need them
-- on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage (cloud storage) and computing power, without direct active management by the user <- Answer (Because we're talking about the defintion itself, not about the benefits)
-- Change resource types when needed

Question 11:
What defines the distribution of responsibilities for security in the AWS Cloud?
-- AWS Pricing Fundamentals
-- The Shared Responsibility Model <- The Answer
-- AWS Acceptable Use Policy
-- The AWS Management Console


Question 12: A company would liek to benefit from the advantages of the Public Cloud but would liek to keep sensitive assets in its own infrastructure. Which deployment model should the company use?
-- Private Cloud
-- Public Cloud
-- Hybrid Cloud <- This is the answer.

Question 13:
What is NOT authorized to do on AWS according to the AWS Acceptable Use Policy?
-- Building a gaming application
-- Deploying a website
-- Run analytics on stolen content <-Answer
-- Backup your data


Regarding AWS Costs:
-- Side Note from Course: Using AWS AI Services is not free, so using it as part of this course will cost money.

-- Let's go into AWS's "Billing and Cost Management" section to look at it.
-- Besides checking your costs and the breakdown, you can set "Budgets", automatic notifications if your costs go over a certain amount.
