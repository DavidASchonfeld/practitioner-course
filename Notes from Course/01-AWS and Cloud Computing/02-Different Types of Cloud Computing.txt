Different Types of Cloud Computing


-- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
---- Provide building blocks for cloud IT
---- Provides networking, computers, data storage space
---- Highest level of flexibility
---- Easy parallel with traditional on-premises IT


-- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
---- removes the need for your organiztaion to maange the underlying infrastructure
---- focus on the deployment and management of your applications


-- Software as a Service (SaaS)
---- completed product that is run and amanged by the service provider

Examples of Cloud Computing Types:

-- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):
--- Amazon EC2 (on AWS) (that's why I learned in college to sue to publish/host websites)
--- Azure, Rackspace, Digial Ocean, Linode, GCP (Google Cloud Platform, a subset of Google Cloud)

-- Platform as a Service (PaaS):
---- Elastic Beanstalk (on AWS)
---- Heroku, Google App Engine (in Google Cloud Platform), Windows Azure (older version of Azure, Microsoft)

-- Software as a Service:
---- Many AWS services (ex: Rekognition for Machine Learning)
---- Google Apps (Gmail), Dropbox, Zoom, etc.



Pricing of the Cloud -- Quick Overview

-- AWS has 3 pricing fundamentals, following the pay-as-you-go pricing model
-- Compute:
---- Pay for compute time
-- Storage:
---- Pay for data stored in the Cloud
-- Data transfer OUT of the Cloud:
---- Data transfer IN is free

-- Solves the expensive issue of traditional IT
