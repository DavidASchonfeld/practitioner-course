Cloud Computing


Cloud Computing: on-demand delivery of compute power, database storage, applications and other IT resources.

-- Through a cloud services platform, with pay-as-you-go pricing.
-- You can provision exactly the right type and size of computing resources you need
-- You can access as many resources as you need, almost instantly
-- simple way to access servers, storage, databases, and a set of application services

-- Amazon Web Services owns and maintains the network-connected hardware required for these application services, while you provision and use what you need via a web application.

Examples of Cloud Services:
-- Gmail (Google stores your emails)
-- Storage: For example: Dropbox
-- Netflix



The Deployment Models of the Cloud

-- Private Cloud:
---- Example: Rackspace
---- Cloud service used by a single organization, not exposed to the public
----- you still have complete control
----- security for sensitive applications
----- meet specfiic business needs
----- will not be discussed in this course

-- Public Cloud
---- Examples: Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services
---- cloud resources ownd and operateds by a third-party cloud service provider delivered over the internet
---- Six Advantages of Cloud Computing (listed below, later in these notes)

-- Hybrid Cloud:
---- keep some servers on premises and extend some capabilities to the Cloud.

The Five Characteristics of Cloud Computing

-- On-demand self-service:
---- users can provision resources and use them without human interaction from the service provider

-- Broad network access
---- Resources available over the network, and can be accessed by diverse client platforms

-- Multi-tenancy and resource pooling
---- Multiple custoemrs acan share the same infrastructure and applications with security and privacy.
---- Multiple customers are serviced from the same physical resources

-- Rapid elasticity and scalability:
---- automatically and quickly acquire and dispose resources when needed
---- quickly and easily scale based on demand

-- Measured service:
---- usage is measured, users pay correctly for what they have used

Six Advantages of Cloud Computers

-- Trade capital expense (CAPEX) for operational expense (OPEX).
---- Pay On-Demand: don't own hardware
---- Reduced Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) & Operational Expense (OPEX)
---- So you don't own it (aka I assume "Capital Expense, CAPEX") and instead pay for Operational Expense OPEX aka paying for renting it.

-- Benefit from massive economics of scale
---- Prices are reduced as WS is more efficient due to large scale

-- Stop guessing capacity
---- Scale based on actual measured usage

-- Increase speed and agility
---- (because its all on-demand)

-- Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers

-- Go global in minutes: leverage the AWS global infrastructure.



Problems Solved by the Cloud

-- Flexibility: Change resource types when needed
-- Cost-Effectiveness: pay as you go, for what you use
-- Scalability: accomodate larger loads by making hardware stronger or adding additional nodes
-- Elasticity: ability to scale out and scale-in when needed
-- High availability and fault tolerance: build across data centers.
