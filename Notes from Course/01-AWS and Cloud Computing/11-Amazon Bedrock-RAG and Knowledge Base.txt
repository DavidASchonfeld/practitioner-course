Amazon Bedrock - RAG and Knowledge Base


RAG = Retrieval-Augmented Generation
Allows a Foundation Model to reference a data source outside of its training data (without being fine-tuned)
-- Bedrock takes are of creating Vector Embeddings in the database of your choice based on your data. (In a later lecture, we'll learn about vector embeddings)
-- use where real-time data is needed to be fed into the Foundation Model


[User]-Who is John's Product Manager?->[AI] --Search for relevant information--> [Knowledge Base] <--Data Source---[Amazon S3 Data Storage]

(Inside the [Knowledge Base] is a Vector Database)

Retrieved Text:
-- John Product Info:
---- Support Contacts:
---- Product Manager: Jessie Smith
---- Engineer: Sara Ronald

Query + Retrieved Text -> Foundation Model --generates response-> "Response: Jessie Smith is the Product MAnage

This is why it is called "Retrieval-Augmented Generation", becuase we are augmenting the Foundation Model with outside information (aka the Knowledge Base).


Ex: Use information for Air travel.

[Amazon S3] -> [Document Chunks] -> [Embeddings Model] (Ex: Amazon Titan, Cohere) -> Stored in "Vector Database"

Vector Database: Choose Which Type:
(Remember these at a high level for the exam)

-- Amazon OpenSearch Service (Options: Serverless & Managed Cluster):
---- search & analytics database real time similarity queries, store millions of vector embeddings scalable index management, and fast nearest-neighbor (kNN) search capability (very scalable,) etc

-- Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL - relational database, proprietary on AWS

-- Amazon Neptune Analytics: if you want graph database, use this option. graph database that enables high performance graph analytics and graph-baesd RAG (GraphRAG) solutions

-- Amazon S3 Vectors: cost-effective and durable storage with sub-second query performance


Amazon Bedrock - RAG Data Sources
