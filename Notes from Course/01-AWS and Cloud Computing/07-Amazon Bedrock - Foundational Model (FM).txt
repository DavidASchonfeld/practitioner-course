Amazon Bedrock - Foundational Model (FM)


Amazon Bedrock - Base Foundation Model:

-- How to choose?
---- Model types, performance requirements, capabilities of the model, constraints of the model, compliance
---- Level of custimization, model size, inference options, licensing agreements, context, windows, latency
---- mulitmodal models (means: models that can take in varied types (images, audio, video, text) of inputs and outputs) 
---- What's Amazon Titan?
------ high-perofrming Foundation Models from AWS
------ can do image, text, multimodal model choices via a fully-managed APIS
------ can be customized with your own data
---- smaller models are more cost-effective, but knows less things

Example: Amazon Titan vs Llama vs Cladue vs Stable Diffusion
(Chart that compares them), is visible around 5:00 in the video.
(I'm only writing here parts of the chrart

Max Tokens (means Max context window)
Stabiliy Diffusion: Only for image generation
Aamzon Titan can do text in +100 Langues
Llama: large-scale tasks, dialogue only English
Claude: high 

Each model has a different pricing for you to use it.


-------
Foundation Model - Hands Only
The test will want you to know what each model can/cannot perform.

Ex: Haiku can do mainly text

Note: There is a compare mode, where you can give 1 prompt and see the results for 2 


Custom Modes
-- on the left menu, you can also select "Custom models"

Customizatoin Techniques:
(From the AWS Descriptions, screenshoted/screenshared in the class lecture)
Reinforcement fine-tuning
- Build more accurate models using reward-based learning with less manual effort, ideal for omplex, multi-step, reasoning tasks.
-- Step 1) Choose model
-- Step 2) Add input data
-- Step 3) Add reward function

Supervised fine-tuning
- Adapts pre-trained models to specific tasks using labeled data to improve perofrmance in specific domains
-- Step 1) Choose model
-- Step 2) Add input data

Distillation
- Creates smaller, faster models by using a large teacher model to train a specialized student model with your invocation logs or generated training data.
-- Step 1) Choose teacher/student model
-- Step 2) Add input data



Click the "Create" button
You choose which custommization technique 
In the form, you choose
-- which model you'd like to customized
-- the hyperparameters (aka how you'd like to train your customized model. These are Machine Learning techniques, so the lecturer "won't go over them too much.")
