Introduction to AI
aka Introduction to Artificial Intelligence


Artificial Intelligence: field of comptuer science dedicated ot solving problems that we commonly associate with human intellignece
Examples:
-- Image Creation
-- Image Recognition (Example: for Self-Driving Car)
-- Speech-to-Text
-- Learning


How does AI work?

-- Training Dataset
Ex: lots of fruits
A Data Scientist will train a model from that training Dataset

Ex: Classification Algorithm:
AI Model will place all the fruits onto the graph and label each grou
Ex: Peaches, Bananas, Apples
The data Scientist trains the AI model on how to classify each fruit for each type of fruit.

User: We show to the AI Model a new image of an apple that the AI Model has never seen before.



History of AI:
-- 1950s: Birth of AI: Alan Turning proposes the Turing Test (the machine has intellignece if it is able to hnave a conversation with a human and fool the human into thinking that it is another human.)
-- John McCarthy invents the term "Artificial Intelligence."

-- 1970s: Expert Systems: The MYCIN System: An AI-Rule-based system to detect bacteria.

-- 1990s: Machine Learning and Data Mining: Can now collect and organize data, and statistic al breakthroughs to start doing algorithms to do machine learning

-- 1997: Deep Blue: IBM machine that can beat the World Champion Chess player.

-- 2010s: Deep Learning Revolutions: Neural Networks and algorithms you see today in modern AI. Ex: 2016: Google's AlphaGo defeats Go World Champion.

-- 2020s: Virtual assistants, autonomous vehicles and healthcare diagnostics, discussions on ethics and regulations


AI Use Cases
-- Transcribe and Translate spoken langauges
-- playing humans in games (Ex: Chess, Go, Starcraft)
-- Driving Cars, Flying Airplaces
-- Speech Recognition and Generaiton
-- Suggesting code for Developers
-- Medical Diagnosis
-- Automating Business Processes
-- Fraud Detection


AI Practical Example:
IDP (Intelligent Document Processing)
-- extract data from a receipt saved as a PDF file

-- AI techniques leveraged
---- Computer Vision (to see the image)
---- Deep Learning
---- Natural Language Processing (NLP)



Artificial Intelligence Today:

-- Artificial Intelligence: overall field
----- Machine Learning: what we use to train the models
-------- Deep Learning: We use Neural Networks
----------- Generative AI (aka GenAI): You think of ChatGPT, Dall-E, etc.
